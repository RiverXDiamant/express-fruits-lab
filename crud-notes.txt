! CRUD

=== Create

A Create or POST creates a new entry in a database that either you or someone else created. When we perform a POST request, we send some amount of information to our data source, usually data from a form; and we create a new entry in the data source.

=== Read

The Read or GET operation is something that you interact with every day. Whenever you pull information from an api, you are performing a GET request. GET requests only allow users to view or read from a data source. This can be something as simple as you checking your email in the morning. We perform a GET request to a server and if everything goes OK we get some type of information or data back.

=== Update

 Update or PUT works very similar to a POST request. We are still sending along some sort of data to our data source, but instead of creating a new entry, we are actually updating an existing entry. In order to this, we need to target that entry specifically, most of the times using an id. This allows us to send some new information to to our existing piece of data and overwrite it's existing attributes.

=== Delete

Delete does just as the name implies it DELETE's something from our data source. We target the specific piece of information in the same way we did with our PUT request. This sends a request to the server to DELETE this item.
