    Create Index, Show Views
    Refactor your application to work appropriately hintviews can be reused but you can also make subfolders in the views folder, take the subfolders approach so that you can still follow along in class.


    When a user goes to the /vegatables route they will see an index of veggies on the page
    When a user clicks on the name of the vegetable, they will be taken to that vegetable's showpage, and will see the vegetables' name and color and if it's READYTOEAT.
